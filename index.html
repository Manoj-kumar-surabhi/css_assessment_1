<ol style="color: brown;">
    <li>Css stands for cascading style sheets</li> <br>
    <li>css describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li> <br>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Css is not neccessary</span><span style="background-color: yellow;"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span> it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li> <br>

<h1 style="color: red;"><i>Css can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h1>
<ul class="ways">
    <li>inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li> <br>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li> <br>
    <li>External-by using a link element in link to an external CSS file.</li> <br>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="bg">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span>,because this is easier to demonstate, and easier for you to ry it yourself.</li>

<p id="para">when comparing CSS class vs ID , the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on yhe other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by javascript. <br>
<br>
    in CSS, seelectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an elements has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element <br>
  <br>  
    there is a widerange of selectors vailable. two of the most commonly used ae class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p> <br>
